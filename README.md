# Image Processing Exploration

Welcome to my personal project repository where I explore various aspects of image processing. This project serves as a platform for me to develop and refine my skills in image manipulation and analysis.

## Project Overview

### Image Interpolation and Enhancement
- **Image Interpolation**: Implementing methods to resize images while preserving quality.
- **Point Operator**: Exploring techniques for adjusting brightness and contrast.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Applying this technique to improve image contrast and detail visibility.

### Advanced Image Processing Techniques
- **Filtering**: Experimenting with different filters to enhance or alter images.
- **Sharpening and Edge Detection**: Techniques aimed at accentuating fine details and identifying edges in images.
- **Smoothing**: Applying smoothing algorithms to reduce noise and improve image quality.

### Geometric Technique Exploration
- **Geometric Detection**: Investigating methods to detect and analyze geometric shapes within images.

## Capstone Project: Object Detection and Image Stitching
- **Object Detection**: Developing algorithms for identifying and locating objects in images.
- **Image Stitching**: Exploring how to merge multiple images with overlapping views to create high-resolution panoramas.
